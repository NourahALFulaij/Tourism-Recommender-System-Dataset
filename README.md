<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p align="center"> 
With tourism being one of the largest industries in the world, a lot of curiosity arouses
about exploring new locations. Travelers who enjoy exploring different cultures and cities have a hard time finding the appropriate information tailored to them before they set out on an expedition.A growing number of tourism mobile applications incorporate recommender systems. As a result
of recommendation systems, much of the information that is generated is eliminated, based on the preferences, interests, or patterned behaviors of the user, in order to avoid information overload.While traditional recommendation systems treat all items equally, in reality, one item may havemore value than another. In this paper, we propose new method that utilizes a weighted parallel hybrid recommendation system. The proposed method outperforms existing recommendation systems since it provides efficient results for a recommender system by improving the accuracy of similarity between items, thus improving recommendation quality accuracy
